## HyperFrames — HTML/GSAP Motion Graphics (zero-key, ~$0)

These use the HyperFrames composition runtime — HTML + CSS + GSAP rendered deterministically to video via headless Chrome + FFmpeg. Perfect for kinetic typography, product promos, launch reels, and website-to-video treatments where the visual grammar is typographic and motion-first.

**Requirements:** Node.js ≥ 22, FFmpeg, `npx` — no monorepo checkout, the CLI is fetched via `npx @hyperframes/cli` on first run.

**Estimated time:** 8-12 minutes | **Cost:** $0 (or ~$0.05 with premium TTS)

### Launch Reel with Registry Blocks

> "Create a 25-second launch reel for a developer tools startup. Include a data chart block (showing user growth from HyperFrames registry), kinetic title cards, and a shader transition between scenes."

## Tips for Better Results

**Be specific about visual components.** Instead of "make it look good," say "use bar charts for the comparison, a donut chart for the breakdown, and stat cards for the key numbers."

**Mention your target audience.** "For junior developers" or "for 8th graders" dramatically changes the script, pacing, and visual style.

**Specify duration.** The agent optimizes content density based on your target length. 45 seconds needs ~110 words of narration; 90 seconds needs ~225 words.

**Request specific chart types.** The system has bar charts, line charts, pie/donut charts, KPI grids, progress bars, comparison cards, and callout boxes. Name the ones you want.

**Ask for the zero-key path.** If you want free results, say "use only free tools" or "no paid APIs." The agent will route to Piper TTS, stock media, and Remotion-only compositions.

**For anime/Ghibli-style videos,** mention the style explicitly: "Ghibli-style" or "anime-style." Describe the atmosphere, lighting, and mood. The agent uses the Animation pipeline with FLUX image generation and Remotion's anime scene engine — multi-image crossfade, camera motion, and particle overlays create the illusion of animation from still images. Cost is minimal (~$0.15 for 30 seconds).
