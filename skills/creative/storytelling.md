## The Explainer Arc Template

For a **3-minute explainer video** (scale proportionally for other lengths):

```
[0:00 - 0:08]  HOOK
               Pattern interrupt or counterintuitive claim. 1-2 sentences max.
               Visual: striking image or animation that creates curiosity.

[0:08 - 0:30]  TENSION / INFORMATION GAP
               "Here's what most people think... but that's not quite right."
               Establish stakes: why should I care?
               Visual: show the misconception or the puzzle.

[0:30 - 0:50]  CONCEPT 1 (Foundation)
               Simplest building block needed. ONE idea, ONE visual.
               End with a "but" or "therefore" transition.

[0:50 - 1:15]  CONCEPT 2 (Complication)
               Build on Concept 1. Introduce the wrinkle.
               Visual: transform/evolve the previous visual.

[1:15 - 1:20]  PALETTE CLEANSER
               Brief pause, visual gag, or "let that sink in" moment.
               Gives working memory a beat to consolidate.

[1:20 - 1:50]  CONCEPT 3 (Key Insight)
               The "aha" moment. Core of the video.
               1-3 seconds of deliberate silence after the reveal.
               Visual: the most polished animation in the video.

[1:50 - 2:20]  PROOF / EXAMPLE
               Concrete demonstration: "Watch what happens when..."
               Visual: show the insight working in a specific case.

[2:20 - 2:45]  IMPLICATIONS / "SO WHAT?"
               Connect back to the real world. "This means that..."
               Scale from specific back to general.

[2:45 - 3:00]  REFRAME + CLOSE
               Callback to the hook. Restate the core insight in one sentence.
               Optional: open a new curiosity gap.
```

## Scaling by Duration

| Length | Concepts | Hook | Tension | Core | Proof | Close |
|--------|----------|------|---------|------|-------|-------|
| 1 min | 1-2 | 5s | 10s | 30s | 10s | 5s |
| 2 min | 2-3 | 8s | 15s | 60s | 25s | 12s |
| 3 min | 3-5 | 8s | 22s | 100s | 30s | 15s |
| 5 min | 5-8 | 10s | 30s | 180s | 50s | 20s |

## Hook Types

| Type | Pattern | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Contrarian** | "Everything you've been told about X is wrong." | Veritasium-style science/myth-busting |
| **Outcome** | "By the end of this video, you'll understand X." | 3Blue1Brown-style math/concept |
| **Mystery** | "In 1987, something impossible happened..." | Kurzgesagt-style story-driven |
| **Stakes** | "This one mistake costs people X every year." | Practical/how-to content |

## The 30-Second Rule

YouTube data shows **50% of viewer drop-off happens in the first 30 seconds**. The hook + tension
setup MUST be complete by second 30. Retention curves that survive the 30-second cliff typically
retain 40-60% through the full video.

## The "But-Therefore" Method

Never connect sections with "and then." Always use **"but"** or **"therefore."**

**Bad:** "Atoms have electrons, AND THEN those electrons have energy levels, AND THEN..."

**Good:** "Atoms have electrons, BUT they don't behave like tiny planets, THEREFORE we need a
completely new model..."

Applied structure:
```
SETUP:     Here's what you think you know about X.
BUT:       Here's why that's wrong / incomplete / surprising.
THEREFORE: We need to understand Y (the real mechanism).
BUT:       Y creates a new puzzle...
THEREFORE: The actual answer is Z.
THEREFORE: This changes how you should think about X.
```

## Misconception-First Approach (Research-Backed)

Derek Muller's PhD research (University of Sydney, 2008) showed that **videos presenting common
misconceptions FIRST, then refuting them, produce significantly higher learning gains** than videos
that simply present correct information. Viewers who watched "misconception-first" videos scored
higher on post-tests and reported higher engagement.

Apply this: always consider opening with what the audience *thinks* is true before revealing what
*actually* is.

## Guided Discovery (3Blue1Brown Method)

Don't explain the answer. **Reconstruct the reasoning path** so the viewer feels they discovered it.

1. **The Question** — Pose a specific, concrete question
2. **The Naive Attempt** — Show the obvious approach; let it partially work, then break
3. **The Key Insight** — Introduce ONE new idea. Pause visually for 2-3 seconds of silence.
4. **The Build** — Apply the insight step by step. Each step feels inevitable.
5. **The Generalization** — "Notice this pattern works beyond our specific example..."

**Progressive Revelation:** Never show the full picture at once. Build visuals layer by layer.
Each layer arrives exactly when the narration references it.

## Pacing Rules

| Rule | Value | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| Narration speed | 150-160 wpm | Kurzgesagt standard (conversational is 170-190) |
| New visual element | Every 3-5 seconds | Kurzgesagt production rules |
| Concept density | Max 1 new concept per 30-45 seconds | Mayer's Segmenting Principle |
| Pattern interrupt | Every 45-90 seconds | YouTube retention data |
| Deliberate silence | 1-3 seconds after key insights | 3Blue1Brown technique |
| Palette cleanser | Every 45-60 seconds | Kurzgesagt production rules |

## Mayer's Multimedia Learning Principles (Applied)

These are the most relevant research-backed rules from cognitive science:

1. **Segmenting** — Max 1 new concept per 30-45 seconds. A 3-min video = 4-6 concept segments.
2. **Signaling** — Use verbal signposts every 30-45 seconds ("Here's where it gets interesting").
3. **Temporal Contiguity** — Narration and visuals must be simultaneous. Learning drops ~30% when offset even by a few seconds.
4. **Coherence** — Remove interesting-but-irrelevant content. "Seductive details" reduce learning by 20-30% on transfer tests.
5. **Modality** — Use narration (audio) + visuals (animation), NOT on-screen text + visuals. Spoken words + pictures outperform written words + pictures.

## Applying to OpenMontage

When writing a **script artifact** for the animated-explainer pipeline:

1. Choose a hook type from the table above based on the topic
2. Structure sections using the Explainer Arc template
3. Apply "but-therefore" connectors between sections
4. Consider the misconception-first approach for science/technical topics
5. Set `narration_wpm: 155` in the script to calculate accurate timing
6. Plan visual changes every 3-5 seconds in the scene_plan
7. Mark "silence" beats in the script for key insights
8. Validate: total concepts should not exceed the scaling table above
