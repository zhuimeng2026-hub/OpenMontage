# Idea Director - Podcast Repurpose Pipeline

## When To Use

Use this pipeline when the source is a podcast episode, either audio-only or video podcast, and the user wants clips, social assets, or a companion long-form video treatment.

Your first responsibility is to decide what is feasible from the source that actually exists.

## Runtime Selection (MANDATORY — present the constraint, don't silently pick)

Lock `render_runtime = "remotion"` (audiograms and composed outputs) or `"ffmpeg"` (pure-audio-led clip exports). **HyperFrames is NOT a valid runtime on this pipeline in Phase 1** — podcast outputs lean on Remotion's word-level caption stack, which has no HyperFrames parity yet.

Per AGENT_GUIDE.md → "Present Both Composition Runtimes (HARD RULE)": surface the constraint to the user — "HyperFrames is available on your machine, but podcast-repurpose depends on Remotion caption burn, so remotion is the only viable choice here". Record a `render_runtime_selection` decision with hyperframes `rejected_because: "caption-burn parity deferred on podcast-repurpose"`.

- `docs/podcast-repurposing-best-practices.md`
- `skills/creative/short-form.md`
- `skills/creative/long-form.md`

## Process

### 1. Classify The Source

Capture the source mode:

- `audio_only`
- `video_podcast`
- `hybrid` (audio plus stills, cover art, guest photos)

Also capture the conversational format:

- solo
- interview
- panel
- narrative / produced show

### 2. Choose Deliverables That Match Reality

Default deliverables should be feasible with the source and tools on hand.

Safe options:

- short-form highlight clips,
- audiogram or caption-led clips,
- quote-led clips,
- one optional full-episode companion layout.

Do not assume a high-production full-episode YouTube treatment unless the source video, branding assets, and optional imagery actually exist.

### 3. Set A Sensible Deliverable Mix

Typical starting point:

- `3-5` highlight clips
- `1-3` quote-led assets if the episode has strong one-liners
- optional long-form companion if the source justifies it

### 4. Respect Platform Differences

- `9:16` for Shorts, Reels, TikTok
- `1:1` for LinkedIn and safer feed repurposing
- `16:9` for YouTube companion video

If the source is audio-only, make that explicit in the brief. Downstream stages should not plan speaker-framed video that does not exist.

### 5. Build The Brief

Use `brief.metadata` for the richer podcast-specific contract:

- `source_mode`
- `show_name`
- `episode_title`
- `episode_number`
- `speakers`
- `conversation_format`
- `deliverable_mix`
- `brand_assets_available`
- `full_episode_companion_feasible`

### 6. Quality Gate

- the deliverable mix matches the actual source,
- clip counts are realistic for the episode length,
- the brief states whether visuals will be source-led, quote-led, or audiogram-led,
- long-form ambitions are scaled to the available assets.

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating audio-only and video-podcast sources as the same production problem.
- Planning too many deliverables from a weak episode.
- Promising a rich full-episode visual treatment without the assets to support it.
