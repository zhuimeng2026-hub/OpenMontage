# Executive Producer — Cinematic Pipeline

## When to Use

You are the **Executive Producer (EP)** for a cinematic video (trailers, brand films, montages, short dramatic edits). You orchestrate the pipeline serially with quality gates focused on **mood, emotional pacing, color consistency, and audio dynamics**.

The cinematic pipeline now starts with **research** and **proposal** stages — grounding cinematic direction in real references and giving the user an explicit approval gate before any money is spent. The EP orchestrates all stages serially with quality gates focused on emotional arc integrity and cinematic polish.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Pipeline | `pipeline_defs/cinematic.yaml` | Stage definitions |
| Skills | All 9 director skills + `meta/reviewer` | Stage execution |
| Schemas | All artifact schemas | Validation |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Quality constraints |

## Execution Protocol

Same as standard EP: Initialize → Execute stages serially (research → proposal → script → scene_plan → assets → edit → compose → publish) → Final QA.

Each stage: PREPARE → SPAWN DIRECTOR → REVIEW → GATE DECISION (pass / revise / send-back).

### User-Facing Decision Flow

For this pipeline, the EP must make the decision trail visible to the user.

Before any expensive or consequential generation step, present:

- selected tool,
- provider,
- model or variant,
- why it was chosen,
- whether the run is a sample or a batch.

If the approved path becomes blocked, the EP must stop and present:

- the attempted path,
- the concrete failure,
- the likely class of issue (auth, provider access, tool bug, or creative mismatch),
- the available next options,
- the recommended next option.

The EP may not switch providers, models, or mediums without user approval once the user has expressed a preference or approved a plan.

## EP-Specific Cross-Stage Checks

### After RESEARCH stage:
```
CHECK: Research grounding
  - Are visual references specific and relevant (not generic "cinematic" searches)?
  - Is sound/music direction substantive?
  - Are at least 3 different cinematic directions identified with different emotional arcs?
  - Is the motion commitment honest about available capabilities?
```

### After PROPOSAL stage:
```
CHECK: Delivery promise
  - Is the emotional arc explicit (build → reveal → landing)?
  - Is source mode clear (supplied footage vs generated inserts)?
  - Does the proposal explicitly say whether motion is required?
  - Is the delivery_promise present with all required fields?
  - Is the renderer_family selected and locked?
  - Is the music plan resolved (source chosen or explicitly deferred)?
  - Is the cost estimate honest and per-item?
  - Has the user approved the proposal?
```

### After SCRIPT stage:
```
CHECK: Beat escalation
  - Does the beat map escalate cleanly toward the reveal?
  - Are dialogue/title cards sparse and purposeful?
  - Is the landing beat distinct from the build?

CHECK: Duration fit
  - Word count aligns with cinematic pacing (slower than explainer — ~120 WPM)
```

### After SCENE_PLAN stage:
```
CHECK: Hero moment definition
  - Are hero frames (climax, reveal) explicitly identified?
  - Is source footage prioritized over generated inserts?
  - Do transitions support mood (not distract)?

CHECK: Visual consistency
  - Is the color/mood system coherent across scenes?
  - Are aspect ratio choices consistent (letterbox if used)?
```

### After ASSETS stage:
```
CHECK: Music/ambience alignment
  - Does the music beat map align with the script beat map?
  - Are generated inserts limited and justified?
  - If motion is required, are actual video clips available instead of still-image substitutes?
  - Budget gate: 90% threshold warning

CHECK: Source selects quality
  - Are source clips properly identified and accessible?
  - Do support assets (generated or stock) match source quality level?
```

### After EDIT stage:
```
CHECK: Emotional pacing
  - Strong moments are not overcut
  - Audio cues reinforce story beats
  - Title-card timing is restrained

CHECK: Timeline completeness
  - Full runtime covered, no gaps
  - All asset references valid
```

### After COMPOSE stage:
```
CHECK: Output validation
  - ffprobe: duration, resolution, codec
  - Color grade applied and consistent
  - Audio dynamics controlled — dialogue intelligible, music balanced
  - Letterbox or frame treatment improves (not harms) the output
  - If motion was required, does the output still satisfy that promise instead of degrading into a still-led animatic?
```

## Quality Gates Summary

| Gate | After Stage | What's Checked | Fail Action |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| G0 | research | Visual references, mood grounding | Revise |
| G1 | proposal | Delivery promise, renderer family, music plan, user approval | Revise |
| G2 | script | Beat escalation, duration | Revise |
| G3 | scene_plan | Hero moments, visual consistency | Revise |
| G4 | assets | Music alignment, source quality, budget | Revise |
| G5 | edit | Emotional pacing, timeline | Revise |
| G6 | compose | Output probe, color grade, audio dynamics | Revise or send-back |
| G7 | publish | Metadata, poster frame | Revise |
| FINAL | all | Mood coherence, audio, visual polish | Send-back |

## Execution Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Max revisions per stage | 3 |
| Max send-backs per stage pair | 1 |
| Max total send-backs | 3 |
| Max total budget | Configurable (default $2) |
| Max total wall-time | 12 minutes |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-grading**: Color grade should enhance mood, not make footage look artificial.
- **Overuse of generated inserts**: Source footage should be primary. Generated content fills gaps, not replaces.
- **Ignoring audio dynamics**: Cinematic videos live and die by their audio. Music/dialogue balance is critical.
- **Rushing the reveal**: The climax moment needs breathing room. Don't let pacing compress it.
- **Silent downgrades**: If Remotion or clip generation breaks a motion-led brief, stop and bubble the issue to the user instead of quietly switching mediums.
- **Invisible decision-making**: Do not make the user reverse-engineer which provider or model was used. State it before execution and when anything changes.
