# OpenMontage â€" Skill Index

> For the full agent onboarding guide, see [`AGENT_GUIDE.md`](../AGENT_GUIDE.md) in the project root.

This file lists all available Layer 2 skills and documents the 3-layer knowledge architecture.

## Knowledge Architecture

```
Layer 1: tools/tool_registry.py          "What tools exist and what they can do"
         tools/base_tool.py               Each tool declares: capabilities, tier, status,
                                          dependencies, cost, and agent_skills[]

         â†" agent_skills[] points to â†"

Layer 2: skills/                          "How OpenMontage uses these tools"
         Project-specific conventions:     Pipeline integration, artifact mappings,
         {core,creative,meta,pipelines}/   enhancement chain order, quality checklists

         â†" references underlying tech in â†"

Layer 3: .agents/skills/                  "How the technology itself works"
         Generic API knowledge from        Correct import paths, code patterns,
         skills.sh (47 installed skills)   constraints, parameters â€" tech-agnostic
```

**How the agent uses this:**
1. The orchestrator queries Layer 1 (`tool_registry.support_envelope()`) to see what's available
2. Each tool's `agent_skills[]` field names the Layer 3 skills it relies on
3. Layer 2 skills (this directory) teach the agent OpenMontage-specific conventions
4. Layer 3 skills (`.agents/skills/`) provide generic API knowledge, loaded on-demand

## Capability Families & Tool Discovery

Every tool declares a `capability` (what it does) and a `provider` (who/what powers it). The registry groups tools by capability so agents can discover all options for a given task.

### Selector / Provider Pattern

For capability families with multiple providers (TTS, video generation), the architecture uses:
- **Selector tool** (`tts_selector`, `video_selector`, `image_selector`) — routes to the best available provider based on requirements, API key availability, and cost. Selectors auto-discover providers from the registry. Agents should default to selectors when the user hasn't specified a provider.
- **Provider tools** — call a specific provider directly. Agents use these when the user explicitly requests a provider or when the selector's routing isn't appropriate.

### Capability Family Reference

**Do not maintain a hardcoded tool list.** The registry is the single source of truth. Query it at runtime:

```bash
python -c "from tools.tool_registry import registry; import json; registry.discover(); print(json.dumps(registry.capability_catalog(), indent=2))"
```

Key capability families to look for in the output:

| Capability | Selector | Discovery |
|---|---|---|
| `tts` | `tts_selector` | Auto-discovers all `capability="tts"` tools |
| `video_generation` | `video_selector` | Auto-discovers all `capability="video_generation"` tools |
| `image_generation` | `image_selector` | Auto-discovers all `capability="image_generation"` tools |
| `audio_processing` | — | FFmpeg-based local tools |
| `enhancement` | — | Mixed providers |
| `analysis` | — | Mixed providers |
| `graphics` | — | Local rendering tools |
| `music_generation` | — | Single-provider |
| `subtitle` | — | Pure Python |
| `avatar` | — | Local GPU models |
| `video_post` | — | FFmpeg-based local tools |

### Adding New Tools

1. Place the tool in the correct capability folder (or create a new one under `tools/`)
2. Set `capability` and `provider` in the class definition
3. If joining a multi-provider family, the existing selector discovers it automatically
4. Attach relevant Layer 2 and Layer 3 skills via `agent_skills[]`
5. The registry discovers tools automatically — no manual registration needed
6. **No other files need updating** — selectors, manifests, and instructions all derive from the registry
